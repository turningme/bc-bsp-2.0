		 <h1> Welcome To BC-BSP !</h1>
		 <p>BC-BSP is an iterative graph processing system built for high scalability. For example, it is currently used at Facebook to analyze the social graph formed by users and their connections.
		 BC-BSP originated as the open-source counterpart to Hama. Both systems are inspired by the Bulk Synchronous Parallel model of distributed computation introduced by Leslie Valiant. BC-BSP
		 adds several features beyond the basic Hama model, including master computation, sharded aggregators, edge-oriented input, out-of-core computation, and more.  To learn more, consult the
		 Introduction section above.
